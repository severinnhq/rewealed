      question: "Why is the motto 'Not for Everyone'?",

      question: "What's the purpose of REWEALED?",

    },
    {
      question: "Why is REWEALED expensive?",
      answer: "Because it's not just a hoodie. It's a symbol of ambition, a statement of purpose, and a connection to a community that values action over excuses. Quality and meaning come at a price—it's for those who understand the difference."
